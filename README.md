# Ola Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing ride-booking data from a hypothetical ride-sharing service called Ola. The dataset contains 40,000 rows of booking data, and the goal is to extract meaningful insights using SQL queries and views.

## Objectives
- Import and analyze a large dataset using MySQL.
- Create SQL views for easy access to frequently queried data.
- Extract insights such as successful bookings, average ride distances, and customer behavior.
- Upload the project to GitHub for version control and sharing.

## Description
The project involves creating a MySQL database, importing data, and performing various SQL queries to analyze the data. Views are created to simplify access to commonly requested data, such as successful bookings, top customers, and cancellation reasons.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the power of SQL in analyzing large datasets. By creating views and writing queries, we were able to extract valuable insights from the Ola booking data. The project highlights the importance of data analysis in understanding customer behavior, ride patterns, and operational efficiency.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Import the dataset into MySQL.
3. Run the SQL queries provided in the repository to analyze the data.
